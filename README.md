# College-Course-Tracker

The purpose of this project is to create an application that can help students track their courses.
The application provides the ability to add new terms with corresponding courses, that have corresponding tests.
The objects are stored in an SQLite database using Room architecture. The Terms/Courses/Test are shown in recycler 
views and each have detailed views. The students can also set alerts for upcoming classes and tests.
